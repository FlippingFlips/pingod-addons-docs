## Log location

In the appdata directory under the game name, logs `.log` are created. Use the `open_app_data.bat` to open directory to open the data directory.

The image above has the users game directory open with Sublime Text.

SublimeText - Game Data Folder
---

The steps to add this directory and save project:

1. Find the games appdata folder with bat file `_godot_appdata_dir.bat`
2. Copy the path and use `Open Folder` in Sublime and open the user path
3. Save this as a project in sublime then reopen it later for a quicker way to view logs, look at your settings etc for this game.

You could do similar with a Visual Studio code workspace or something else, this is just one example of getting back to viewing this directory.
