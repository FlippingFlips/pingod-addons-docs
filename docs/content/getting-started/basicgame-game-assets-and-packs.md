You may want to make a base asset pack to copy and load across multiple games or ship game with separate packs for easier updating.

---

See [Link separate assets project](../../exporting/link-separate-assets-project/) on how to make from linking.

Your assets will keep the same file structure, so to reach one of your assets in script the path would be `"res://assets/img/myimage.png`.
