Now that the game is building and running it can be launched with Visual Pinball.

- Table can be run from any location in Visual Pinball. 

- The controller will load the game when the vp player is launched.

Use the `_vp_edit.bat` or `_vp_play.bat` to open the table easier

Provided you have the controller setup and have built the godot project this will play.

### COM Controller setup
---

We need to register the COM object before it can be used by other applications such as a simulator.

---
#### Register controller
---

1. Download the latest at [pingod-controller-com/releases](https://github.com/FlippingFlips/pingod-controller-com/releases)
2. Extract the download anywhere on your system (if following this guide it may pay to create a new folder `pingod-controller-vp` inside `pingod`)
3. Run the `PinGod.VP.Setup.exe` to unregister / register the COM object
4. If you move these files then you would have to register it again.

---
#### Simulator Scripts
---

1. Copy the scripts directory to your visual pinball directory. This would be something like `C:\Visual Pinball\Scripts`

|Script|What For?|
|---|---|
|core_c_sharp.vbs|a copy of core.vbs but with slightly different ways to invoke methods in C#|
|PinGod.vbs|a machine definition file|

## Debugging
---

When debugging you can load the game direct from the `BasicGameGodot` directory as you would in the previous section only with the controller.

This table script is set to `Debug = True` and to look for `..\`, which is a level up in this repository.

These settings will run the game debug with the Godot editor, show display and also a console window.
