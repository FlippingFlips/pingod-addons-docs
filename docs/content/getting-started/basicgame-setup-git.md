Using Git to clone the repositories

#### (Option 1) Clone
---

1. Create a directory on machine where you are developing named `pingod`, this could be anything but we need a directory to clone into.

2. Browse into the `pingod` directory just created and use keypress `ALT+D` then type `cmd` and enter, to open windows cmd prompt in that directory.

3. Clone the `pingod-addons` with `git clone https://github.com/FlippingFlips/pingod-addons-docs`
