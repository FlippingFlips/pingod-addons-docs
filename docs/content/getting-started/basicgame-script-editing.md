### Script editing / Editing .tscn files outside of Godot editor
---

It's not great to use the Godot editor for editing C# scripts. We prefer to use Visual Studio, but with any text editor you can build changes made in Godot.

#### [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/free-developer-offers/)

Bigger install, full ide, code completion

#### [Visual Studio Code](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/free-developer-offers/)

Smaller, quicker to load a project directory, code completion, has a terminal.

#### [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/)

Smaller text editing, this is good for using saved directories and viewing the contents of the games app_data and logs.
