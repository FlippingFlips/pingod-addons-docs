## Scenes using this
---

Most modes rely on this being loaded by using `GetNode<PinGodGame>("/root/PinGodGame")` from the script.

This scene doesn't house any other scenes, it's autoloaded with the game and you can add your own and override its script if need to.

The BasicGame uses its own script based on PinGodGame named `CustomPinGodGame` which is autoloaded with the plugin.
