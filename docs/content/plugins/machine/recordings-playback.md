Quick guide on how to record and playback a game. 

Recording a game can speed up your game development for game logic.

They would usually start off by using trough switches then adding credits and starting a game.

Any events after this to test any recorded sequence like clearing a target bank, draining your ball.

Testing modes and testing the complete game.

## Recording

Recording files are saved in the user://recordings/recordname.record

Example game dir: *C:\Users\UserName\AppData\Roaming\Godot\app_userdata\BasicGameGodot\recordings*

You can get to the app_data directory for the game using app_data bat file
