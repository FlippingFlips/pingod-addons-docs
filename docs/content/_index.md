-- DOCUMENTATION MOSTLY OUT OF DATE WHEN IT COMES TO EXAMPLES, BEING WORKED ON. IT'S A BIT EASIER WITH THE NEW DEMO.tscn scene and plugins instead of `BasicGame` --

## What is it?
PinGod is for creating pinball game logic with graphics display window. A `pinball machine` or a `simulator` can trigger the game and vice versa.
Using the Godot engine these addons can be imported into a godot project and be ready to modify or build on.

---
## Why that name?
The Godot game engine was used so it's `Pinball + Godot = PinGod`.

#### `PinGo` or `PinGodot`?  
We know who the penguin is and `PinGodot` doesn't ring well. This isn't a holy framework but you can make games fast like a `Pin God` so we can rest the case on that decision.

---
## Is it difficult to learn and use?
Not really. Godot doesn't have a steep learning curve and you don't need to know everything to be able to finish a game or make scenes. There are full examples in the `src` with `basic to advanced` scripted games which will give you an idea of C# sripting tasks and how things were done. You should be able to lean back on PinGod doing the machine work for you while you compose scenes and do some simple C# scripting.

---
## Advantages?
- Framework base that covers standard pinball machine features used across games
- C# scripting (or GScript)
- Easy to make 2D, 3D graphics scenes
- Collaborating with others on Scenes / Scripts
- Localization
- Recording/Playback of games saves much time in testing
