The BasicGame project below shows that the first project is `Windows Desktop Runnable` and is exporting to `..Build/PinGod.BasicGame.exe`

This window can be found in Godot `Project > Export`. 

Export option "embed pck" does not work on 32-bit x86 [GodotIssues](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/35830)

The names here have to be consistent which each other. The exe and the pack.

The BasicGame project for `Windows Desktop Pack` shows that it's exporting to `..Build/PinGod.BasicGame.pck`

## Excluding Assets
---

Added this exclude filter on the Runnable and the Desktop Pack to not add any files in `assets/*`.

This asset folder is usable in the `BasicGameGodot` game directly but as the directory is excluded here for exporting from then we can build an asset pack from another project.
