This doesn't apply if you decide to have a single executable and pck, so you can skip this

*Note: This could have changed in Godot 4, untested*

When a project uses mono C# it includes mono assembilies which are around 29mb.

If you try to export the assets only from this project, then you will always have the c# files.

One workaround method is to use the `BasicGamePck/project.godot` project. This project is empty, no scenes or C# scripts.
