If you need to change the icon, which by default PinGod does then you will need `RCEdit`.

- Make icon with all size in one file
- A. Download [RCEdit (Github)](https://github.com/electron/rcedit/releases) and add the path in Godots `Editor Settings\RCedit`
- B. Or use chocolatey `choco install rcedit`
- Change icon in the Godots `Project Settings/Application/Config`
