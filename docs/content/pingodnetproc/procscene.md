This scene is the first scene to load. It is a placeholder with nothing to load inside of it apart from two CanvasLayers, which are placeholders for `Modes` and an `Overlay`.

When the game is running, any modes that need to be visible can be added to the `Modes` CanvasLayer. 

The CanvasLayers have a priority, so that covers mode priority in a similar fashion to DMD layers / modes from the original P-ROC.
