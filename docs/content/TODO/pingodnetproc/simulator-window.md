In the `autoload/Machine.tscn` you can enable a switch window. This window is embedded and kind of a hack but allows to run multple windows.

If your main display is set to full screen then you would want two displays to show the switch window.

On the window you can push switches in a separate window to the game which is quicker than key presses especially when it comes to the trough as you can toggle all here.

`playfield_control.tscn` is the default layout but you should make a copy of this for your own.
