var relearn_search_index=[{content:` Plugins / Autoload Some pingod-addons have a plugin that you can enable or have an AutoLoad singleton when the plugin is enabled. These should work in any order you enable them.
Open the project settings to view Plugins and Autoload
AutoLoad When some plugins are enabled they also have an Autoload class and they will be in this view. You can access these by the name in any scene script like root/PinGodGame. You can edit these Autoload scenes however you wish but you can also override them by duplicating any as needed. When the plugin is enabled it will look in the res://autoload/ for the matching scene name to override. If you made a copy of Resources.tscn to res://autoload/Resources.tscn then your scene will override the default scene.
How to override autoload scenes If you wanted to edit and add more switches to the plugin then you could have your own copy of Machine.tscn. In Godot you can duplicate the default Machine.tscn like so:
Note:It is better to do this kind of thing duplicating and moving files inside Godot. Godot will update any references as needed
In the FileSystem pane filter files. Filter it for machine The one we want is Machine.tscn. There will be just a few results. Right click and Move/Duplicate To Create and select autoload folder and copy the file here Disable, then Enable the plugin in for the plugin to pick up your new AutoLoad scene. You will see a console message that your scene was found in the autoload. `,description:"",tags:null,title:"About Plugins",uri:"/pingod-addons-docs/plugins/about/index.html"},{content:`Add translations for the game.

NetProc library - Project References The csproj in this directory has references to NetProc which are installed from the nuget packages folder.
The folder for the packages is set in the nuget.config. You won’t need to worry about this unless you update the NetProc, which is just a case of adding packages to the nuget folder and updating to a newer version in the csproj.
Note: When running a real board you need to build as x86. If the game is not set to simulated then it will load the pinproc library

Filter the files in godot for score and duplicate it, rename it to MygameScoreMode or anything like that. You want to move the file after it’s created to somewhere in your root like res://scenes.
The following image is the steps above and loaded.
If you select the ScoreMode node and look in the inspector these are the options from that script.
Focusing on the Score Labels this is where you can select the scores for the players. If you had a 10 player game you could add some more labels and select them here.
Customizing It’s up to you what you do here but you are not limited to anything but imagination.
I have made several different score displays all using this as a base which are all a bit different.
You can extend the script, so this script can cover most scoring, so all you worry about here is making it nice with Godot and the game will handle the scores.
Extend ScoreMode.cs If you click on the script dropdown in the ScoreMode inspector window, as 2nd image shows then you can extend from here.
Click extend then C#, the name should be the same as your scene but with the .cs extension.
Godot will asign this script after extending but the base class is incorrect. Change this from Node to ScoreMode.
using Godot; using PinGod.Modes; using System; public partial class MyTemplateScoreMode : ScoreMode { }Now you can do what you like here too if you need something extra in the mode.
An example would be overriding the OnScoresUpdated and updating other things like other player stats in the game that you have in your scene.

The WriteStates here is used by the PinGodProcGameController in the RunLoop.
proc/MemoryMapPROC.cs This script overrides the existing memory map and stops writing states to memory. This is just for simulating so you can disable the plug-in if running a real board.
These states are written by the p-roc game loop here by getting the _lastCoilStates or _lastLedsStates and writing them to the mapping.

About P-ROC Modes The p-roc modes have some methods to override. The ones you’ll mainly be using are:
method Description ModeStarted Called when the mode is added to the Game.Modes ModeStopped Called when the mode is remove from the Game.Modes. This mode when stopped removes the CanvasLayer from the Modes Canvas UpdateLamps When the game calls UpdatesLamps this will be called Canvas - Optional Visible Layer This base mode has a Godot CanvasLayer which has an integer property of Layer. The layer is the order drawn or visible. The P-ROC Mode priority is set here.
Any scenes (nodes) you want to show here can be added to this CanvasLayer.
method Description AddChildSceneToCanvasLayer(Node node) Creates the CanvasLayer if null and adds the node to it. RemoveChildSceneFromCanvasLayer(Node node) Remove a node from the Canvas CreateCanvasLayer(string name, int priority, bool addAsChild = true) Creates a new Canvas layer and adds to the ProcScene/Modes See examples in the modes/AttractMode.cs or modes/ScoreDisplayProcMode.cs

_link_addons.bat This file is explained in previous here but it will link the addons folder into the game so you are not duplicating files, just reusing the addons.
project.godot This is the Godot project for the game. It uses the .csproj and .sln to build mono c#.
You can edit the project.godot before launching it with Godot and change the name in there to save time under config/name.
Under the [dotnet] section you can change the assembly name from PinGod to your name. If you do this just delete the PinGod.csproj and PinGod.sln files then when you run it in Godot create a new C# which will create the solution and project.
Loading project first time Run the addons link so you have the addons enabled and have a shortcut to it. Run project with godot with the editor flag -e After loading you should see the addons directory. If you go to Project Settings > Input Map you can see some inputs to control the window.
Playing first time If you try to play the project then it will ask for a scene. Just create any old scene name it MainScene and set that as the start up. You can right click any scene to set as startup or run a scene with F6.
Play the project and you should be greeted with a grey screen window, push ESC to close but doesn’t close. You need to wire ESC to close the window or we can use the plugin WindowActions.
Enabling a plugin Go to Project Settings > Plugins and you will see a list of plugins that have been loaded from the addons folder.
Enable the WindowActions. What this will do is add an Autoload entry and autoload when a game is run. Even if you are running a scene on it’s own, these autoload also load there.
You maybe greeted with an error here, this could be because you’re missing a csproj and solution.
To fix this, create a new C# script in the root inside godot, this will trigger it to create those files.
A build button should now be available (top right of Godot), build the project then enable the WindowActions.
Using the WindowActions plugin Load the game again and use ESC, which should now close the game. F2 will also be available to toggle the window border
Enabling all plugins Enable all plugins and you should be greeted with a similar log to this.
Using the addons default startup - MainScene Duplicate the MainScene.tscn into the root and set that to run first scene.
In this scene is an Attract mode, Pause and settings setup and can run the default game scene.
If you run the scene with all plug-ins enabled you will be able to add credits and play a complete game, that is, start it, drain balls, show bonus until a game over.
To troubleshoot, push F1 and change the logging level to verbose or debug in the PinGod tab.
You can reset the game with F3, move the window by toggling the border with F2.
Enable a Switch window A switch window can send switches to the machine which is much faster than using key presses.
To enable this go to your duplicated autoload/Machine.tscn and in the inspector Switch Window.
Enable it and QuickLoad the window scene by filtering for playfield. Select PlayfieldWindow.
Run the game and you will have a window to push switches. To customize see the Playfield Switch Window

Adjustments Game adjustments table with means to be shown in a UI.
Rows should have unique keys with their MenuName and SubMenuName to be used for service menus and the like. A default example would be a parent / child STANDARD_ADJ / GENERAL.
Value must be integer. OptionType is the type of options display in a UI.
0 = A range of ints like 8,30 or 0,15 1 = List ints like 0,1,2,3 or 10,20,75 2 = Enum like NO,YES which would be 0,1 to display text for option Players There is a player named default with initials (display name) set to NETPROC. Players should have a unique login name but display name (initials) could be the same as another player.
Players are used in the BallsPlayed and Scores tables.
Scores Scores stored here against he GamePlayedId and PlayerId are storing the total points scored in that game.
Games Played Games played just stored the start and end time of the game with the duration and the adjustments that were set.
Balls Played Saves every balls score for each player and the duration.

What is it? PinGod is for creating pinball game logic with graphics display window. A pinball machine or a simulator can trigger the game and vice versa. Using the Godot engine these addons can be imported into a godot project and be ready to modify or build on.
Why that name? The Godot game engine was used so it’s Pinball + Godot = PinGod.
PinGo or PinGodot? We know who the penguin is and PinGodot doesn’t ring well. This isn’t a holy framework but you can make games fast like a Pin God so we can rest the case on that decision.
Is it difficult to learn and use? Not really. Godot doesn’t have a steep learning curve and you don’t need to know everything to be able to finish a game or make scenes. There are full examples in the src with basic to advanced scripted games which will give you an idea of C# sripting tasks and how things were done. You should be able to lean back on PinGod doing the machine work for you while you compose scenes and do some simple C# scripting.
Advantages? Framework base that covers standard pinball machine features used across games C# scripting (or GScript) Easy to make 2D, 3D graphics scenes Collaborating with others on Scenes / Scripts Localization Recording/Playback of games saves much time in testing `,description:"Documentation for PinGod games",tags:null,title:"Home",uri:"/pingod-addons-docs/index.html"},{content:"",description:"",tags:null,title:"Categories",uri:"/pingod-addons-docs/categories/index.html"},{content:"",description:"",tags:null,title:"Tags",uri:"/pingod-addons-docs/tags/index.html"}]
