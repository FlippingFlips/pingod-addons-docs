## Building docs offline

The site requires [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to build or run. The Doxygen file configuation is built to the `docs/public/html` directory



This site uses the [hugo-theme-techdoc](https://github.com/thingsym/hugo-theme-techdoc) as a submodule and this can be updated by running:

`git submodule foreach git pull origin main`

## HUGO tech docs site
---

The docs directory is a HUGO website generator. You can run this locally and make edits to the markdown.

`hugo server -w` - This will run server and watch for file changes

Build the hugo site into a directory named public:
